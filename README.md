# extra_survival_mod

This mod is meant to be a small addition of extras across different fields, meant to improve living inside the wilderness spawn.
Besides allowing a basic extra plant to grow in the forests (dead bushes), it also allows for wild corn, oats, wheat and cotton to spawn inside forests at a very rare chance, as well as enabling the finding of clay and sand tiles across fields randomly.

It adds some extra convenience to a small amount of recipes, an expensive gunpowder and black gunpowder craft that is autolearned a reasonably high cooking and survival levels as well as makeshift wooden water containers, plant clothing for early naked survival, wooden vehicle parts and some more things.

# extra_survival_mod

This mod is meant to be a small addition of extras across different fields, meant to improve living inside the wilderness spawn.
Besides allowing a basic extra plant to grow in the forests (dead bushes), it also allows for wild corn, oats, wheat and cotton to spawn inside forests at a very rare chance, as well as enabling the finding of clay and sand tiles across fields randomly.

It adds some extra convenience to a small amount of recipes, now coming with a black gunpowder craft that is taught inside survival books at a reasonably high cooking and survival level. This uses natural substances like sugar or drinking alcohol besides saltpeter which can be gained from guano. Other than that there are makeshift wooden water containers, plant clothing for early naked survival, wooden vehicle parts and some more things.

Weapons added:
Wooden and Iron-Tipped Lance - these weapons provide the desirable REACH_3 tag, meaning it can attack past 2 tiles, yet come at the disadvantage of being dreadfully slow and not dealing great amounts of damage. Require piercing skills to make. Also beware, the wooden lance is considered to be flimsy.
Guncotton rifles - guncotton (Nitrocellulose) can work totally fine for a charge. The problem it has it that guncotton is volatile and and needs to burn down, not be impacted. These rifles pack a good punch and guncotton can be crafted relatively early, given you have a survival book.
Wooden bike wheels that can actually be steered - designing a steering axle is not really difficult, even for a proper vehicle. it always bugged me that wooden cart wheels wouldn't allow for steering.

Beware - Acid Rain is enabled and this may throw you off.

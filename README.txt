Thanks for checking out my small mod, as it improves wilderness survival and hopefully makes the experience more enjoyable.
Besides allowing some of the basic plants to grow in the wild, this mod gives you some earlier crafting options for wooden containers.
Beware, acid rains are enabled!
Other things the mod does is add convenience to some recipes that I could think off, other than that. well... whatever I feel could need improvements
One of the things I currently changed is also the broken cyborg spawn, as the leaky bionic is absurdly brutal and deminishes any effort.



Credit to Myasofei for adding a bunch of ideas and giving me the proper input to actually write this mod
